**Project Title:** Developing a BDD‑Based CTL Model Checker

**Project Concept (100 words or less):**
We will design and implement a model checker for Computational Tree Logic (CTL) using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to represent state sets symbolically. Starting from a user‑specified transition system and CTL formula, the tool will construct BDDs for atomic propositions, compute predecessor and fixpoint operations, and evaluate temporal operators (EG, EU, AF, etc.) efficiently. We’ll compare its performance against an explicit‑state checker on benchmark examples, analyze memory and runtime trade‑offs, and document how BDD variable ordering impacts scalability. The final deliverable includes source code, test suite, and a performance report.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
